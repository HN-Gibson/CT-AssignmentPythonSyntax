#Objective: The aim of this assignment is to understand and apply Python's naming conventions, particularly for variables and constants.

#Task 1: Code Correction: You have been given a piece of code with several variable and constant names that don't follow the Python naming convention. Your task is to correct them:

PI = 3.14159 #changed to "PI" to shorten, used uppercase to note it is a constant, and added 3 digits to make calculations more accurate
user_age = 25 #switched to snake_case to avoid case confusion in referencing the variable
user_state = "New York" #changed "location" to "state" for greater clarity/specificity
MAX_USER = 1000 #added an _ to follow snake_case & changed "LIMIT" to "USER" to clarify what the variable is referencing

print (PI,user_age,user_state,MAX_USER) #added a print line to test that variable assignment works
