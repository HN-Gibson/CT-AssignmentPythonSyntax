#Objective: The aim of this assignment is to get familiarized with basic arithmetic operations and understand how they can be applied in everyday situations.

#Task 1: Grocery Store Math Calculate the total cost of three items you'd commonly find in a grocery store, given their individual prices. For example, what would be the cost of bread, peanut butter, and jelly be? Prices don't need to be realistic!

#assigned values to variables representing the cost of grocery
cost_bread = 4.99
cost_pb = 2.99
cost_jelly = 3.99

#assigned sum of ingredients to a variable to be printed
cost_pbj_ingredients = cost_bread + cost_pb + cost_jelly

#printed to show outcome
print (cost_pbj_ingredients)

#Task 2: Bank Interest If you have a savings account with a particular initial amount and a fixed yearly interest rate, calculate the total amount in your account after a year. So if you had $10,000 at a 7% interest write code that would tell us the amount at the end of the year. For the example the expected outcome would be $10,700.

#assigned values to variables based on the prompt
savings_amount = 10000.00
yearly_interest_rate = .07 #converted percentage to float format for easier calculation
end_of_year_total = savings_amount + savings_amount * yearly_interest_rate #used variables in an equation to find the new savings amount and assign it to a variable

print (end_of_year_total) #print the end_of_year_total variable to see the result
